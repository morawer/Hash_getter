# Hash_getter
A little script to get the hash the differents files.


### UBUNTU
if you need to use it i recommend you to create a enviroment variable, for example:

```
export hash_getter='python3 /home/dani/Projects/Hash_getter/hash_getter.py'
```
Now you can use it using '$' before variable:

```
$hash_getter ZAset-setup.zip
```
the script will returns the hash:

```
HASH: 2985d2591ca47eee73f6c52214bb5f7f5661c9462bd607e7482cf4b22daa5285
```

Thanks!!
